answer="Content Security Policy is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks."
additional_feedback="

    Correct.

    XSS attacks exploit the browser's trust in the content received from the server. 
    Malicious scripts are executed by the victim's browser because the browser trusts 
    the source of the content, even when it's not coming from where it seems to be coming 
    from.

    CSP makes it possible for server administrators to reduce or eliminate the 
    vectors by which XSS can occur by specifying the domains that the browser should 
    consider to be valid sources of executable scripts. A CSP compatible browser will 
    then only execute scripts loaded in source files received from those allowed domains, 
    ignoring all other scripts (including inline scripts and event-handling HTML attributes).

    As an ultimate form of protection, sites that want to never allow scripts to be 
    executed can opt to globally disallow script execution.

answer="While IP handles actual delivery of the data, TCP keeps track of segments - the individual units of data transmission that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the network."
additional_feedback="

    Correct.

    For example, when an HTML file is sent from a web server, the TCP software 
    layer of that server divides the file into segments and forwards them individually 
    to the internet layer in the network stack. The internet layer software encapsulates 
    each TCP segment into an IP packet by adding a header that includes (among other data) 
    the destination IP address. When the client program on the destination computer receives 
    them, the TCP software in the  transport layer re-assembles the segments and ensures they 
    are correctly ordered and error-free as it streams the file contents to the receiving 
    application.

    In this example, while the main thread is parsing the HTML and CSS,
